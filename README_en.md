DrawScript is a visual RPA (Robotic Process Automation) system. Design automation workflows by dragging and connecting nodes in a browser-based flowchart editor. The server parses the flow and drives a lightweight Python agent on a remote Windows machine to perform mouse clicks, keyboard input, image recognition, and more — no heavy installation required on the target machine.

> **Who it's for:** Anyone who wants to automate repetitive desktop tasks, from non-programmers who prefer a visual approach to developers and QA engineers who want structured, reusable automation scripts.

## ✨ Features

### Visual Flow Editor
- Drag-and-drop flowchart editor powered by **AntV X6**
- Branching (condition nodes), loops, and sub-script calls
- Live node highlighting during execution for real-time feedback

### Rich Node Library

| Category | Node | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Control flow | Start / End | Flow entry and exit |
| Control flow | Condition | IF / ELSE branching with multi-condition AND / OR logic |
| Control flow | Loop | Counted loops; loop count can come from a variable |
| Control flow | Script | Call another script; supports variable input/output mapping |
| Desktop | Action | Mouse click / double-click / move / drag / scroll; keyboard type / hotkey / key press |
| Desktop | Screenshot | Capture the client screen and store as a variable |
| Desktop | Wait / Delay | Timed delay or wait for a condition |
| Vision | Vision | Template match / OCR / AI vision / color detection (see below) |
| Data | Compute | Run arbitrary Python code on the client |
| Data | Variable | Set / modify typed global variables |
| Network | HTTP | Send HTTP requests with `{{variable}}` template interpolation |
| Network | Crawl | Extract data with CSS / XPath selectors, or via the Firecrawl API |
| Context | Context Edit | Read and write execution context variables |

### Four Computer Vision Backends

| Backend | Technology | Typical Use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Template matching | OpenCV | Locate fixed icons or buttons |
| OCR | PaddleOCR | Read text from the screen |
| AI vision | Qwen-VL and other multimodal LLMs | Understand complex UI; locate elements with natural language |
| Color detection | OpenCV HSV | Detect specific color regions |

### Multi-client Management
- One server controls multiple Windows clients simultaneously
- Scripts are bound to a specific client; executions are isolated

### Persistent Execution Logs
- Every run is logged to SQLite with multi-dimension query support
- Jump from a log entry directly to the corresponding node in the flow editor

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Pre-built Release (Recommended)

> No Python or Node.js required on the target machine — download and run.

#### 1. Start the Server (Linux)

Download `draw-script-server-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/victorzhou123/draw-script/releases/latest), then extract and start it:

```bash
tar -xzf draw-script-server-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd draw-script-server-{version}
./start.sh
```

Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser.

To customize the port or log level, pass environment variables:

```bash
DS_PORT=8080 DS_LOG_LEVEL=debug ./start.sh
```

#### 2. Start the Windows Client

Download `draw-script-client-{version}-windows-amd64.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/victorzhou123/draw-script/releases/latest), extract it, and run:

```
draw-script-client.exe
```

On first run, an **interactive setup wizard** appears: enter the server IP/port, a unique client ID, and a display name. CUDA DLL directories are detected automatically. The configuration is saved to `config.toml` in the same directory and loaded on subsequent starts.

> **Note:** The release client is built in CPU-only mode; OpenCV GPU acceleration is not available. For CUDA support, use the source-based setup below.

---

### Option B: Run from Source

> Requires Python 3.10+ and Node.js 18+ (server), plus Python 3.10+ on the Windows client.

#### 1. Start the Server

**Step 1 — one-time environment setup**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victorzhou123/draw-script.git
cd draw-script/server

# Install backend Python dependencies (once only)
pip install -r kernel/requirements.txt
```

**Step 2 — choose a launch mode**

```bash
# Production mode (recommended for deployment)
make prod
# · Builds the frontend automatically (npm install + npm run build)
# · Backend runs in the background; logs written to server.log (info level)
# · Open http://localhost:9001 in your browser

# Development mode (foreground, hot reload)
make dev
# · Backend runs in the foreground with debug logging; restarts on code changes
# · Vite dev server starts alongside (http://localhost:5173)
# · Ctrl+C stops both services

# Development mode (background)
make dev-bg
# · Same as dev but both services run in the background, logs go to server.log
# · Useful for remote SSH sessions or when you don't want to occupy a terminal

# Stop all services
make stop
```

#### 2. Start the Windows Client

Copy the `client/` directory to the **Windows machine** and run:

```bat
start.bat
```

On first run it automatically:
1. Checks that Python is installed
2. **Runs an interactive setup wizard**: enter the server IP/port, a unique client ID, and a display name; CUDA DLL directories are detected automatically
3. Installs the right dependencies (CPU or CUDA build) based on the server's GPU setting for this client
4. Starts the agent and connects to the server

Subsequent runs skip the wizard, update dependencies, and launch immediately.

---

### Create Your First Script

1. Open the server URL in your browser (default `http://localhost:9001`)
2. Create a new script in the left sidebar
3. Drag in **Start** → **Action** (mouse click) → **End**
4. Click the Action node and configure the target coordinates in the right panel
5. Select a client in the toolbar and click **Run**
6. Watch the Windows client move the mouse while the active node highlights in real time

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Server Environment Variables

The server reads all settings from environment variables. The Makefile presets sensible values for each mode. To launch manually or override any setting:

```bash
# Example: custom port and log level
cd server/kernel
DS_HOST=0.0.0.0 DS_PORT=8080 DS_LOG_LEVEL=debug python3 main.py
```

Full variable reference:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DS_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `DS_PORT` | `9001` | Listen port |
| `DS_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log level: `debug` / `info` / `warning` |
| `DS_RELOAD` | `false` | Enable uvicorn hot reload (set to `true` for development) |
| `DS_DB_PATH` | `draw_script.db` | SQLite database file path |
| `DS_TEMPLATES_DIR` | `templates` | Directory for template images |
| `DS_AI_API_KEY` | — | Default AI vision API key (can also be set in the UI Config Center) |
| `DS_AI_BASE_URL` | Alibaba DashScope | AI vision API base URL |
| `DS_AI_MODEL` | `qwen-vl-plus` | Default AI vision model |

### Client Config (`client/config.toml`)

Generated automatically by the first-run wizard. You can also edit it manually:

```toml
[server]
url = "ws://YOUR_SERVER_IP:9001/ws/client"

[client]
id = "pc-001"       # unique ID — must match what you bind scripts to in the UI
name = "PC-001"     # display name
platform = "windows"

[cuda]
dll_dirs = []       # CUDA/cuDNN DLL directories; auto-detected on first run
```

### AI Vision / Firecrawl API Keys

Add API keys in the server's **Config Center** UI. No code changes or environment variables needed.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Scheduled / cron execution
- [ ] Per-node execution timeout
- [ ] Script import / export
- [ ] Linux / macOS client support
- [ ] Additional CV backend integrations

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

**Adding a new node type:** create a file under `server/kernel/engine/nodes/`, subclass `BaseNodeHandler`, decorate it with `@NodeRegistry.register("type_name")`, then add a matching config form under `server/web/src/components/node-forms/`.
